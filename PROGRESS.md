# genai-electron Implementation Progress

> **Current Status**: Phase 1 MVP Complete + Example App Running ✅ (2025-10-16)

## Completed Work

**Phase 1: MVP - LLM Support**
- Core library implementation: SystemInfo, ModelManager, LlamaServerManager
- TypeScript compilation: 24 source files, zero errors
- Test infrastructure: Jest 30 + ts-jest operational (14/14 tests passing)
- Documentation: README.md, docs/API.md, docs/SETUP.md

**Example Application: electron-control-panel (Phase 1)**
- ✅ Full Electron app demonstrating genai-electron runtime management
- ✅ System Info tab: Hardware detection and recommendations
- ✅ Model Management tab: Download models from HuggingFace/URLs, manage storage
- ✅ LLM Server tab: Start/stop/restart server, auto-configuration, test chat, logs
- ✅ Dark theme UI with 40+ components and comprehensive styling
- ✅ **App successfully launches and runs** (2025-10-16)
- ⚠️ Known issues: Some UI polish needed, API responses may need validation

**Critical Learning: ES Modules + Electron + Vite**
- Package has `"type": "module"` but Electron requires CommonJS for main/preload
- **Solution**: Output `.cjs` files explicitly (main.cjs, preload.cjs)
- Vite configs must use `rollupOptions: { output: { format: 'cjs' } }`
- This is now documented in example app for future reference

**Status**: Phase 1 complete. Example app functional and ready for development use.

**Recent Fixes (2025-10-17): Log Display & TestChat**
- Fixed TestChat hanging issue: Added `stream: false` to prevent llama.cpp streaming response conflicts
- Added AbortController with 30s timeout to prevent indefinite hangs
- Implemented intelligent llama.cpp log parsing at library level (`llama-log-parser.ts`)
  - llama.cpp logs everything as [ERROR]; library now categorizes as debug/info/error based on content
  - HTTP 200 requests → info, slot operations → debug, actual failures → error
  - Strips llama.cpp's duplicate timestamps before storage (clean single-timestamp display)
- Wired up Clear Logs button to truncate log file (full IPC chain: renderer → main → library)
- Known issue: TestChat still has ~50-70% random failure rate (needs investigation with clean logs)

**Next**: Phase 2 - Image Generation (diffusion.cpp integration, resource orchestration)

**Detailed Records**: See `docs/dev/phase1/` for complete Phase 1 planning and progress logs.
