## Completed Phases

### Phase 1: MVP - LLM Support ✅ (2025-10-16)

**Core Features:**
- SystemInfo: Hardware detection (CPU, RAM, GPU, VRAM), intelligent recommendations
- ModelManager: Download GGUF models from HuggingFace/URLs, storage management, checksums
- LlamaServerManager: Start/stop llama-server processes, auto-configuration, health monitoring
- Binary Management: Automatic download and variant testing for llama.cpp binaries
- Reasoning Support: Automatic detection for reasoning-capable models (Qwen3, DeepSeek-R1, GPT-OSS)

**Deliverables:**
- Core library with comprehensive test coverage
- electron-control-panel example app (System Info, Models, LLM Server tabs)
- Complete documentation (README.md, docs/API.md, docs/SETUP.md)

**Detailed Progress:** See `docs/dev/phase1/` for complete Phase 1 planning and logs

### Phase 2: Image Generation ✅ (2025-10-19)

**Core Features:**
- DiffusionServerManager: HTTP wrapper for stable-diffusion.cpp with on-demand spawning
- Multi-stage progress tracking: Loading → Diffusion → Decoding with self-calibrating estimates
- ResourceOrchestrator: Automatic LLM offload/reload when RAM/VRAM constrained
- Binary Management: CUDA dependency handling, variant testing with real functionality tests
- GGUF Integration: Pre-download metadata extraction, accurate layer counts, generic architecture support

**Deliverables:**
- DiffusionServerManager + ResourceOrchestrator (fully tested)
- electron-control-panel enhancements (Diffusion Server, Resource Monitor tabs, GGUF Info modal)
- Automatic resource orchestration (prevents system crashes)
- Cross-platform CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- ServerManager refactoring (eliminated ~100+ lines of duplication)

**Detailed Progress:** See `docs/dev/phase2/` for complete Phase 2 planning, logs, and app development details

### Phase 2.5: Async Image Generation API ✅ (2025-10-23)

**Core Features:**
- Async polling pattern for image generation (POST returns ID, GET polls status/progress)
- Batch generation support with `count` parameter (1-5 images per request)
- GenerationRegistry for in-memory state management with TTL cleanup
- Progress tracking for batched operations (currentImage/totalImages fields)
- Sequential batch generation with automatic seed incrementation

**Deliverables:**
- GenerationRegistry class with automatic cleanup (configurable TTL)
- Refactored HTTP endpoints (breaking change from synchronous to async)
- 27 comprehensive unit tests for GenerationRegistry
- Updated type definitions (GenerationStatus, GenerationState, batch progress fields)
- Exported utilities (generateId) and new types

**Technical Details:**
- Breaking API change: `/v1/images/generations` POST now returns `{id, status, createdAt}` immediately
- New endpoint: `GET /v1/images/generations/:id` for polling status/progress/result
- Registry TTL: 5 minutes default (configurable via `IMAGE_RESULT_TTL_MS` env var)
- Cleanup interval: 1 minute default (configurable via `IMAGE_CLEANUP_INTERVAL_MS` env var)
- Batch generation: Sequential execution with overall progress calculation
- Error codes: SERVER_BUSY, NOT_FOUND, INVALID_REQUEST, BACKEND_ERROR, IO_ERROR

**Migration Impact:**
- HTTP clients must migrate from blocking pattern to polling pattern
- Example app will need updates to use async API
- Backward compatibility: None (intentional breaking change for better UX)

## Architectural Decisions

Key design decisions that inform future development:

**1. Transparent Resource Orchestration**
- `DiffusionServerManager.generateImage()` automatically uses ResourceOrchestrator when initialized with `llamaServer`
- Users don't choose between "safe" and "unsafe" APIs - orchestration happens automatically
- Prevents system crashes from OOM without requiring orchestration knowledge

**2. Configurable Metadata Fetch Strategies**
- Default: `'local-remote'` (tries local file first, auto-fallback to remote if corruption detected)
- Rationale: Some GGUF files trigger parsing errors locally; resilient fallback maintains speed + reliability
- Options: `'local-only'` (fastest), `'remote-only'` (authoritative), `'remote-local'` (prioritize authoritative)

**3. Binary Validation Caching**
- First start: Full validation (2-10s), results cached with SHA256 checksum
- Subsequent starts: Checksum verification only (0.5s) - 4-20x faster
- Auto re-validation on binary modification, manual `forceValidation` flag for driver updates

**4. Generic GGUF Architecture Support**
- `getArchField()` helper dynamically constructs field paths: `${architecture}.${fieldPath}`
- Supports ANY architecture (llama, gemma3, qwen3, mistral, phi, mamba, gpt2, falcon, future models)
- Replaces hardcoded extraction functions - future-proof design

**5. Real-Time Memory Checks with Strategic Caching**
- Dynamic data (available RAM): Always use real-time `getMemoryInfo()`
- Static data (CPU cores, GPU specs): Use 60-second cache from `detect()`
- Cache invalidation: Automatic after server start/stop to reflect memory state changes
- Prevents false "Insufficient RAM" errors when loading models sequentially

## Key Achievements

### Test Infrastructure
- **246/246 tests passing** (100% pass rate) across 12 test suites
- **Jest 30 + ESM**: Clean exit, no warnings, no memory leaks
- **Fast execution**: ~3.5 seconds for full test suite
- **Comprehensive coverage**: Unit tests for all managers, integration tests for workflows

### Cross-Platform Compatibility
- **Windows, macOS, Linux**: All npm scripts work across platforms (cross-env, rimraf)
- **Binary variant testing**: Automatic fallback (CUDA → Vulkan → CPU) with real functionality tests
- **GitHub Actions CI/CD**: Automated testing on all platforms, code quality checks, security audit

### Production Readiness
- **Zero TypeScript errors**: Strict mode compilation, full type safety
- **Zero runtime dependencies**: Uses only Node.js built-ins (lightweight, no supply chain risk)
- **Comprehensive documentation**: API reference, setup guide, architecture docs, examples
- **Example application**: Full-featured electron-control-panel demonstrating all features
