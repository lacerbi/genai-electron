# Test Suite Assessment

## Overview
- **Framework**: Jest (ESM mode with `jest.unstable_mockModule` for dependency injection).
- **Scope**: 12 unit-level suites, 221 total assertions, all green in ~3.1s on the current branch.
- **Goal coverage**: Core managers (`LlamaServerManager`, `DiffusionServerManager`, `ResourceOrchestrator`, `ModelManager`, `StorageManager`, `BinaryManager`), shared utilities (`Downloader`, `SystemInfo`, `health-check`, `file-utils`, `platform-utils`), and error definitions.
- **Philosophy**: Every suite stubs external effects (filesystem, network, child processes) so tests stay deterministic and fast. This makes them excellent for catching behavioural regressions in business logic, while real IO/process paths remain the responsibility of integration testing.

## Suite-by-Suite Summary

| Suite | Focus | Highlights |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `errors.test.ts` | Custom error hierarchy | Validates codes, message formatting, and structured `details` payloads. |
| `platform-utils.test.ts` | Platform/arch helpers | Exercises branching per OS/arch flag including edge-case fallbacks. |
| `file-utils.test.ts` | Filesystem helpers | Confirms sanitisation, metadata handling, and error mapping without touching the real FS. |
| `StorageManager.test.ts` | Model metadata storage | Covers directory structure, usage reporting, metadata read/write, and error paths. |
| `ModelManager.test.ts` | Model lifecycle | Verifies listing, download orchestration, checksum validation, deletion, and error translation. |
| `SystemInfo.test.ts` | Capability detection | Mocks OS/GPU probes, checks caching, recommendation heuristics, and platform-dependent branches. |
| `Downloader.test.ts` | Streaming downloads | Uses fake fetch/streams to confirm progress callbacks, cancellation, resume logic, and error propagation. |
| `LlamaServerManager.test.ts` | llama.cpp host | Covers start/stop/restart, health polling, crash handling, log capture, configuration injection, and binary resolution. |
| `DiffusionServerManager.test.ts` | diffusion wrapper | Exercises HTTP wrapper endpoints, process spawn, progress parsing, config validation, and cleanup. |
| `ResourceOrchestrator.test.ts` | Cross-service resource control | Asserts GPU/RAM estimation, offload/reload sequencing, state caching, and success/failure paths. |
| `BinaryManager.test.ts` | **NEW** Binary variant management | Tests variant fallback (CUDA→CPU), checksum verification, caching, platform cleanup, download errors, and binary testing. |
| `health-check.test.ts` | **NEW** HTTP health checking | Validates checkHealth/waitForHealthy/isServerResponding with exponential backoff, timeouts, retry logic, and error handling. |

Collectively these suites give strong confidence that high-level orchestration behaves as intended across success, validation, and failure scenarios.

## Strengths
- **Broad surface area**: Major public-facing modules are covered, especially where regressions would be costly (download pipeline, server managers, orchestration, binary management).
- **Mock-focused isolation**: By swapping real dependencies with stubs, suites run quickly and deterministically, making them useful for CI gating.
- **Failure-path validation**: Many tests assert detailed error cases (e.g., ports in use, insufficient resources, checksum failures), reducing the chance of regressions in user-facing messaging.
- **Cleanup discipline**: Recent fixes ensure HTTP servers, timers, and event emitters are torn down, which keeps Jest workers clean and avoids flaky hangs.
- **Critical infrastructure coverage**: BinaryManager and health-check tests now protect variant selection, checksum security, and server reliability—previously identified as high-risk gaps.

## Addressed Gaps (2025-10-19)

### ✅ Binary management (`BinaryManager`)
   - **Previous state**: Indirectly covered through server-manager mocks.
   - **Risk addressed**: Regressions in variant prioritization or checksum enforcement.
   - **Solution**: Added 19 focused unit tests covering:
     - Variant fallback order (CUDA → CPU → Vulkan)
     - Checksum verification for all variants
     - Binary caching and variant preference
     - Platform-specific cleanup (Windows .exe, Unix chmod)
     - Download/extraction error handling
     - Binary testing with --version flag

### ✅ Process lifecycle helpers - health-check module
   - **Previous state**: Exercised indirectly via higher-level suites.
   - **Risk addressed**: Contract mismatches in timeout enforcement and retry logic.
   - **Solution**: Added 22 focused unit tests covering:
     - `checkHealth()`: Status parsing, timeouts, error handling
     - `waitForHealthy()`: Exponential backoff, retry logic, attempt counting
     - `isServerResponding()`: Simple ping with timeout enforcement
     - AbortController timeout handling
     - All status codes and error paths

## Remaining Gaps & Risk Mitigation
These tests intentionally avoid hitting real binaries, network IO, or long-lived processes. That keeps them fast, but leaves a few blind spots we should acknowledge:

1. **Process lifecycle helpers (`ProcessManager`, `log-manager`)** - PARTIAL
   - *Current state*: `health-check` now fully tested. `ProcessManager` and `log-manager` still indirectly covered.
   - *Risk*: Contract mismatches in process kill logic, log rotation bugs.
   - *Recommendation*: Add focused tests for ProcessManager.kill() timeout enforcement and LogManager rotation boundaries. Lower priority now that health-check is covered.

2. **Integration smoke coverage**
   - *Current state*: No end-to-end test ties the Downloader, ModelManager, BinaryManager, and server managers together, even with stubbed binaries.
   - *Risk*: Wiring issues between modules (e.g., configuration plumbing, shared temp paths) would only surface in manual testing.
   - *Recommendation*: Consider a lightweight integration test that runs entirely against temp directories and stub binaries. It should exercise `modelManager.downloadModel` → `llamaServer.start` → `llamaServer.stop` with mocks that are less granular than the unit suites. Mark it as optional/slow so it can be skipped in constrained CI.

3. **Concurrency and queuing behaviour**
   - *Current state*: `ResourceOrchestrator` tests cover the single-request offload/reload path.
   - *Risk*: Once advanced queuing/cancellation lands (Phase 3 roadmap), concurrency bugs become more likely.
   - *Recommendation*: When those features ship, expand the suite with simulated overlapping requests to confirm queue order, timeout handling, and cancellation semantics.

4. **Platform-specific parsing edge cases**
   - *Current state*: `SystemInfo` and utility suites cover representative cases, but more esoteric GPU detection outputs (e.g., ROCm, Apple Silicon with fallback text) are mocked minimally.
   - *Recommendation*: Add regression fixtures as they surface in the wild; the existing suites are structured to make that easy.

## Verdict
The current unit tests fulfill their role of guarding core logic and catching regressions quickly. **The two highest-priority gaps (BinaryManager and health-check) have been addressed with comprehensive test coverage.** Additional testing should be incremental and strategic—targeting the remaining cross-cutting helpers (ProcessManager, log-manager) and limited-scope integration flows—so we keep the fast feedback loop while increasing confidence in the glue code that isn't directly exercised today. At present no urgent test gaps threaten release quality, but the remaining enhancements above will give us better defence-in-depth as the project evolves.
