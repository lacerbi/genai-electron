# Completed Work and Fixes

**Phase 1: MVP - LLM Support**
- Core library implementation: SystemInfo, ModelManager, LlamaServerManager
- TypeScript compilation: 24 source files, zero errors
- Test infrastructure: Jest 30 + ts-jest operational (14/14 tests passing)
- Documentation: README.md, docs/API.md, docs/SETUP.md

**Example Application: electron-control-panel (Phase 1)**
- ✅ Full Electron app demonstrating genai-electron runtime management
- ✅ System Info tab: Hardware detection and recommendations
- ✅ Model Management tab: Download models from HuggingFace/URLs, manage storage
- ✅ LLM Server tab: Start/stop/restart server, auto-configuration, test chat, logs
- ✅ Dark theme UI with 40+ components and comprehensive styling
- ✅ **App successfully launches and runs** (2025-10-16)
- ⚠️ Known issues: Some UI polish needed, API responses may need validation

**Critical Learning: ES Modules + Electron + Vite**
- Package has `"type": "module"` but Electron requires CommonJS for main/preload
- **Solution**: Output `.cjs` files explicitly (main.cjs, preload.cjs)
- Vite configs must use `rollupOptions: { output: { format: 'cjs' } }`
- This is now documented in example app for future reference

**Recent Fixes (2025-10-17): Log Display & TestChat**
- Fixed TestChat hanging issue: Added `stream: false` to prevent llama.cpp streaming response conflicts
- Added AbortController with 30s timeout to prevent indefinite hangs
- Implemented intelligent llama.cpp log parsing at library level (`llama-log-parser.ts`)
  - llama.cpp logs everything as [ERROR]; library now categorizes as debug/info/error based on content
  - HTTP 200 requests → info, slot operations → debug, actual failures → error
- Fixed log display showing duplicate timestamps/levels: `LogManager.parseEntry()` now trims `\r` carriage returns
  - llama.cpp outputs lines with `\r` at end, which broke regex parsing and caused fallback to duplicate formatting
- Wired up Clear Logs button to truncate log file (full IPC chain: renderer → main → library)

**Reasoning Model Detection (2025-10-17)**
- Implemented automatic detection of reasoning-capable GGUF models
- Created simple pattern-matching system for known reasoning models (Qwen3, DeepSeek-R1, GPT-OSS)
- Added `supportsReasoning` field to ModelInfo type (automatically detected and persisted)
- LlamaServerManager now adds `--jinja --reasoning-format deepseek` flags when starting reasoning models
- Exported `detectReasoningSupport()` and `REASONING_MODEL_PATTERNS` for public use
- Updated API documentation with reasoning detection section
- Zero configuration required - works automatically based on GGUF filename patterns
